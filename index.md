ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pkoopongithub

ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in psychometrics and the open source development of psychometric tests and much more ... Since 2012, the DÃ¼sseldorf student inventory, open source, has served as a learning environment for students of social sciences and trainees in market and social research, application development and data and process analysis. The DÃ¼sseldorf student inventory is an open source, valid, precise and independent personality inventory for students in the transition classes (valid, reliable, objective). The DÃ¼sseldorf student inventory is open to development. I am happy to provide the raw data, SPSS files, R files and source codes of the programs (Internet, PC, Android- , iOS smartphone available (PHP, MySQL, Xcode, Android Studio, Xamarin, Lazarus).
